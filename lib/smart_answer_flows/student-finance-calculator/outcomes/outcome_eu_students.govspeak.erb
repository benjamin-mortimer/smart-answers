  ##Tuition costs

  You could get a [Tuition Fee Loan](/student-finance/eu-students) - <%= number_to_currency(tuition_fee_amount, precision: 0) %> per year.

  The loan pays for the cost of your course and must be paid back.

  <% if course_type == 'eu-full-time' %>
    ##Living costs

    Most EU full-time students don't qualify for help with living costs (known as 'maintenance').
  <% else %>
    ##Living costs

    EU part-time students don't qualify for help with living costs (known as 'maintenance').
  <% end %>

  ##Extra help

  You could get a [bursary or scholarship](/extra-money-pay-university) from your university or college. Usually, this doesn't have to be paid back.

  Use the [Turn2us grant search](http://grants-search.turn2us.org.uk/) to check whether you qualify for funding from a charitable trust.
