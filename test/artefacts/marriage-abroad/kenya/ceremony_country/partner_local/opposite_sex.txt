The UK doesn’t issue certificates of no impediment (CNI) for marriages in Commonwealth countries.

The British High Commission can provide a letter confirming this which you can give to the Kenyan authorities if you are normally resident in Kenya.

^If you’re not normally a resident in Kenya then contact the relevant local authorities in Kenya to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.^

The Kenyan authorities may also ask you to provide a sworn affidavit before a local lawyer, about your marital status. If you have been married before you will need to provide a divorce decree absolute to the Kenyan authorities.

If you have previously lived in the UK you may be asked for a no trace letter issued by the General Register Office.  A no trace letter can be obtained from the General Register Office by calling +44 (0)300 123 1837 (Monday to Friday, 8am to 8pm).
